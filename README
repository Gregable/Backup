Simple Python Backup Script.

Works with mounting encfs filesystems on top of any other filesystem (in my
case NFS, could be removable storage or whatever).  Code written in python,
heavy lifting performed by rsync.

Configurable to use snapshots and various frequencies with a simple cron setup.
See the docstring of backup.py for more information.
