# List of file paths to rsync.  Any line that doesn't contain a space is a
# file path.  Paths can be filenames or directories.  This is simply the
# argument passed to rsync.  As a result, you can use rsync features like adding# a "./" directory to tell rsync which components of the path to sync over.
